# Week 1 Introduction to SQL - Assignment Answers

### 1. Components of a DBMS

1. **Database Engine**: Responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data.
2. **Query Processor**: Interprets and executes SQL queries.
3. **Schema**: Defines the structure of the database, including tables and relationships.
4. **Data Manager**: Handles the organization and modification of data in storage.
5. **User Interface**: Allows users to interact with the DBMS (e.g., GUI or command line).

### 2. What is a Relational Database? Give 4 Examples.

A relational database organizes data into tables (rows and columns) and uses relationships between tables to manage data.

**Examples:**

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server

### 3. Classifications of SQL

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Defines and modifies the database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Handles data operations like inserting, updating, or deleting (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
3. **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Retrieves data from the database (e.g., `SELECT`).

### 4. Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table (e.g., `StudentID` in a student table).
- **Foreign Key**: Links two tables by referencing the primary key in another table (e.g., `CourseID` in a grades table linking to the courses table).

### 5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?

It is a visual representation of a databaseâ€™s entities (e.g., tables) and their relationships. It helps design and structure a database.

### 6. Advantages of Relational Databases

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
2. **Flexibility**: Easily handles complex queries and relationships.
3. **Scalability**: Supports large amounts of data.
4. **Data Security**: Allows controlled access to sensitive information.

### 7. Four Types of Data Types Used in Tables

1. **Integer**: Stores whole numbers (e.g., `INT`).
2. **String**: Stores text (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`).
3. **Date/Time**: Stores dates and times (e.g., `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`).
4. **Float**: Stores decimal numbers (e.g., `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`).

### 8. Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)

It helps to:

1. Store and organize data efficiently.
2. Allow easy retrieval and modification of data using queries.
3. Ensure data security and integrity.
4. Manage large volumes of data effectively.
